# Computer Vision Pokedex

### Tools used

This was built with PyTorch/FastAI for the Machine Learning part and Flask as a Webserver. For containerization and easy deployment I use Docker. 

### Data

To create the data set I've used two different Data Sources. First I've used an alredy exiting pokemon (first generation only) dataset got from [kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/lantian773030/pokemonclassification). To increase the number of Image I've used the Bing Image API to automate the download more images for each pokemon. You can find it how in this collab
